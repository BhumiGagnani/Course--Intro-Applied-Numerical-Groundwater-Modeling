# A1.2 Underground Storage

### *Learning Outcomes*:

After working through the material, the participant should be able to:

1. Explain the basic concepts and terminologies used to describe the subsurface water storage in saturated and unsaturated conditions.
2. Recall the particle size distribution and its relation to ability to store groundwater.
3. Define the different types of storage and classify them for different types of porous media.
4. Differentiate and relate the pressure head, hydrostatic head, and hydraulic head
5. Calculate the amount of released groundwater from confined and unconfined aquifer storage.
