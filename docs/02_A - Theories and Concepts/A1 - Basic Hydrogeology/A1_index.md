This part covers the required theoretical knowledge of basic hydrogeology. This knowledge lets you understand how the underground is composed and how water is stored and moves through various underground structures.

The part contains ten teaching blocks with a 30 to 45 min workload each. The total workload is approximately 8 hours. Each teaching block comes with:

- **Learning objectives** to help you identify the content
- An **introduction assessment** to help you understand your current state of knowledge
- **Course notes**, based on slides, to allow you to read and understand the content
- An **ending assessment** to help you understand whether you met the learning objectives
- Plus optional and additional resources, e.g., links to relevant resources on the web.
