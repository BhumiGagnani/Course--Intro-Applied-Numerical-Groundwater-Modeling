> ###  ðŸ“ƒ[Overview](Overview.md)
>
> This part of the course is aimed at providing an overview and in-depth insight into qualitative and quantitative hydrogeology, focusing on MAR.

##### <u>Some important notes:</u>
- The content is divided into learning/teaching blocks of 30-45 minutes.
- Each block starts with defining learning objectives, followed by pre-assessment questionnaires, learning material, and post-assessments.
- Experienced target groups (for example, university lecturers and graduate students in hydrogeology) may skip some or all of the blocks if they find a good state of pre-assessment and familiarity with the provided material.
- Methods are introduced in general without a specific focus on any application.
